        <h1>Lion and Rat</h1>
        <p>
            In a dense forest, a mighty lion roamed, feared by all creatures. One day, after a satisfying hunt, the lion
            lay down for a nap beneath a shady tree. Nearby, a tiny rat scurried about, accidentally waking the lion by
            running across his paw.

            The lion roared, his paw pinning the trembling rat. "How dare you disturb me! Why shouldn't I eat you?" The
            rat, though terrified, pleaded, "Spare me, and someday I might help you in return." Amused, the lion
            laughed, "How could someone as small as you ever help me?" But he let the rat go.

            Days later, the lion was caught in a hunterâ€™s net. His mighty roars shook the forest. Hearing his cries, the
            rat rushed to the scene. With sharp teeth, he gnawed through the ropes, setting the lion free.

            "Thank you," said the lion humbly. "Even the smallest friend can be the greatest ally."
